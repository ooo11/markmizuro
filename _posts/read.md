Early this year, like everybody else I made my New Year's resolution to take my time reading 1 hour a day. Sounds like a vauge dream but I have plans to do do it.

Last December, I managed to hack my way to start reading end of and ended up finishing a book. This is rare for me because most of the books that I've bought, end up at the store rack. In this essay I will share you my hack to read.

Using the technique from [Atomic Habit](https://www.markmizuro.com/posts/fokus), I start with the easiest way to start reading by read together with an audiobook. I open up YouTube to find the audiobook and start reading for 5 minutes. I did this 5 minutes every day and its the easiest read I have ever done. Its like watching a movie and while reading the subs. Eventually, 5 minutes became 10, 10 minutes become 30, and a few days before Christmas I manage to complete the book. 

I use Iphone's Book app to track my readings. Today is my 12 days strike reading 1 hour each day. My previous strike this year was 11 days, which meant 23 hours of reading this year. The outcome; I manage to complete [Deep Work]() and [Anything You Want](). These two books completely change my life. If it wasn't for [Deep Work](), I wouldn't manage to make this site. 

I found that reading habits change my view of life. As they put it:

"Despite the enormous quantity of books, hew few people read! 
And if one reads profitably, one would realize how much stupid stuf the vulgar heard is content to swallow every day."

\- Voltaire (French writer, historian, and philosopher)
