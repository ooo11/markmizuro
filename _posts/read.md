Like many others, I set out early in the year to read for one hour a day, taking my time. It may seem like a far-fetched idea, but I intend to pursue it.

I finished a book last December after hacking my way into the reading process. This is unusual for me considering the majority of the books I purchase wind up on the store shelf. I'll share my reading technique with you in this essay.

By following the approach from [Atomic Habit](https://shope.ee/2fmXuPjW8p), I began my reading habit in the simplest way possible by reading along with an audiobook. I searched for the audiobook on YouTube and dedicated 5 minutes each day to this practice. It felt incredibly easy, almost like watching a movie with subtitles while reading. Over time, I gradually increased my reading time from 5 to 10 minutes, and eventually, just a few days before Christmas, I successfully finished the entire book.

I use Iphone's Book app to track my readings. Today is my 12 days strike reading 1 hour each day. My previous strike this year was 11 days, which meant 23 hours of reading this year. The outcome; I manage to complete [Deep Work](https://shope.ee/4KulttFTFV) and [Anything You Want](https://shope.ee/2VT8XAcuUI). These two books completely change my life. If it wasn't for [Deep Work](https://shope.ee/4KulttFTFV), I wouldn't manage to make this site. 

I've been using the iPhone's Book app to keep track of my reading progress. Today marks my 12-day streak of reading for 1 hour each day. My previous streak this year was 11 days, which adds up to a total of 23 hours of reading so far this year. Thanks to this consistent reading habit, I was able to successfully complete both [Deep Work](https://shope.ee/4KulttFTFV) and [Anything You Want](https://shope.ee/2VT8XAcuUI), two books that have had a profound impact on my life. In fact, [Deep Work](https://shope.ee/4KulttFTFV) played a crucial role in helping me create this website.

I've discovered that cultivating reading habits has transformed my perspective on life, as the French goes:

"Despite the enormous quantity of books, hew few people read! 
And if one reads profitably, one would realize how much stupid stuf the vulgar heard is content to swallow every day."

\- Voltaire (French writer, historian, and philosopher)

So, what are you waiting for? Pick up a book, put on your headphones, and try reading while listening to the audiobook. See if you can sustain it for at least 5 minutes. Let me know how it goes!
