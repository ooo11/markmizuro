The initial spark for my interest in writing was ignited by an essay by Paul Graham titled **[How to Start a Startup](https://www.paulgraham.com/start.html)**. This essay played a pivotal role in my journey of learning how to launch my own startup, and it introduced me to the world of Y Combinator. At the same time, his inspiration lead me to this site that you are now reading. 

The road ahead is long, but the path is clear. After spending one year as an executive at a local IT company and dedicating five years to the marine business, I feel that the time has come to pursue my dream. Years ago it seems far fetch but now, its just in front of my eyes. Join me on my journey, and let's be successful together.
