One day, a colleague asked me, "How do you manage to sell your sofa so quickly?" He was curious because he had put his laptop for sale on Facebook Marketplace and Mudah.com but hadn't been able to sell it, and it had been a year since he posted the listing.

He asked me where I posted my items, so he downloaded the app and began posting. I explained to him that it doesn't work like that. The first step is to initiate sales and build a positive rating. Start by selling easy, low-cost items that won't strain you financially. Concurrently, accumulating ratings is crucial to demonstrate that you're a genuine seller and, most importantly, not a scammer.

Once you've started selling and built up a rating, the next crucial step is to make it easier for people to discover your listings. This involves paying attention to the quality of your item photos, the accuracy of your product names, and your pricing strategy. Pricing decisions are entirely up to you, but it's important to recognize that most items depreciate in value over time unless they are collectibles. When it comes to photo quality, remember that people are drawn to visually appealing images, and they do judge a book by its cover. As for product naming, you can easily find the correct product names online to ensure accuracy. 

During the 2021 lockdown, I had a side hustle reselling used game consoles. We purchased them from others and sold them on various online platforms. Through this experience, I learned a lot about selling items on the internet. It's surprisingly straightforward - when there's demand for a product, and the price is competitive, people are willing to make the purchase.

How to know the price is right. Lets use the sofa that I just sold. 
1. Price bought and deliver RM 1000
2. Price of the New sofa now RM1000
3. Length use: 1 year
4. Price for transport (Within KL): RM 200

Since the sofa was only a year old, I initially aimed to get at least RM800 for it. However, selling it at the same price as a new one wouldn't make sense. The total of RM800 plus RM200 for transportation would equal the cost of buying a new sofa. Therefore, I decided to set the price tag at RM600, making it RM800 inclusive of transportation.

So I have 2 option for my listing price. 
1. RM800 including transport
2. RM600 

I decided to use the 2nd option which the buyer can arrange the transport on their own. In a week I get a lot of potential buyers seeking to buy the sofa. End of the week, I manage to get my money. 

In summary, the most effective approach to selling online involves starting with easy-to-sell items, building up positive ratings, ensuring quality product photos, using accurate product names for easy discovery, and finally, set competitive pricing.
