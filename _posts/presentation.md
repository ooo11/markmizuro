I do all of the presentation last year and the total numbers of meeting is 96 per year. Over the years, working alone, my boss decide to hire more sales engineers. I reqest them to join me as they have nothing to do during their probation period.

Thease guys are good. Makes me think that Gen Z mostly love talking and socialize. In one of the meeting, I decide to let them do the talking. It was a mistake. 

Luckily this is not our critical client. After the meeting, I decide to train them to do presentation. 1 presentation per week. 

From this experience of teaching others, I will share my knowledge to you the details to master of giving presentation.

Five points to do a great presentation:
1. Know your audience.
2. Know your strength. 
3. Have an attention grabber on the start of the presentation.
4. Two way communications. 
5. Summarize.

**Know Your Audience**

Knowing your audience provide you a great advantage during the presentation. You will know how to address them, their background (technical / non technical), which language to converse and which point might interest them in the presentation. Idealy, do your research well before you start to present. 

**Know Your Strength** *and Weekness* 

Without going too deep to this topic, knowing what you know and what you do not so that you can avoid speaking on it during the presentation. 

**Have an Attention Grabber**

There are 3 ways to do this and inspired by a youtube video that I watch years ago [1]:
1. Start with a questions that matters to the audience. 
2. Start with facts that shock the audience into rethinking.
3. Start with a story that connect you to why the topic is important to you.

**Two Way Communications**

Use this to interact with your audience.

**Summarize** 

Give a short summary and key takeaways to conclud and reinforce what you have pointed out.
