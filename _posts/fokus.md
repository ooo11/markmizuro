After reading Deep Work and Atomic Habits, I've incorporated a lifestyle centered around "Deep Work," which means working with intense focus and no distractions. Before we dive into this further, please take a look at my daily schedule.

- 0430 : Wakes up and start my ritual.
- 0435 : Coding.
- 0630 : Ready to work
- 0700 : Make coffee and breakfast
- 0740 : Go to work.
- 1730 : Back home and rest.
- 1830 : Help wife to cook for dinner and chores. 
- 1930 : Dinner
- 2000 : Coding.
- 2130 : Read books.
- 2230 : Tidur

Question: How do you start your day as early as 4:30 AM? How do you manage to read for 1 hour?

"Atomic Habit" encourages us to establish new habits through the simplest scheduling to make them a routine. Reading a book for 1 hour every day may seem daunting. However, if we start this habit in the easiest way, such as reading for just 3 minutes a day, achieving 1 hour will become more manageable. Here is the "atomic habits" process that can be adapted into your daily life.

1. Choose a new habit. (Reading a book)
2. Select the easiest way to perform that habit. (Reading a book for 3 minutes)
3. Commit to doing the habit every day without fail, and it will become a part of you. (Reading a book for 3 minutes every day)

I've applied the same process to learn JavaScript, waking up early, and reading books. The reading habit has enabled me to delve into the documentation of React and NextJS frameworks. By using "deep work" and "atomic habit," I've been able to master complex subjects, such as dense reading materials and coding. Here is the "deep work" process I've adopted.

1. Choose a suitable place for "deep work." (An office space with a chair and desk)
2. Ensure the chosen place is a comfortable and distraction-free environment. (Appropriate lighting for reading, have beverages on hand)
3. Begin with your ritual. (Prayer)
4. Get to work. (Reading a book)

"Deep work" is more challenging to practice compared to "atomic habits." However, if you succeed, you can master any type of reading material. One tactic, documented to help us avoid losing focus, is as follows:

1. Using Twitter, Email, Whatsapp. (Understanding that Twitter is just a tool and we have the power to control it)
2. Following the news. (Understanding that news should be filtered. You can filter news by asking friends or researching current issues)
3. Utilizing free time for thinking. (Training yourself to engage in critical thinking during your free time)
