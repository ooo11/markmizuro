Early this year, like everybody else I made my New Year's resolution to take my time reading 1 hour a day. I managed to hack my way to start reading end of December last year and ended up finishing a book which is rare for me. Most of the books that I've bought, end up at the store rack. The hardest part of this hack is to start the reading habits. 

Using the technique from [Atomic Habbit](https://www.markmizuro.com/posts/fokus), I start with the easiest way to start reading. Read together with an audiobook. I open up YouTube to find the audiobook and start reading for 5 minutes. I did this 5 minutes every day for 1 month before the end of 2023.
